### Question 0

*  Draw a concepts diagram that uses all the following Github terminology 
   * Include any missing keywords that will simplify the concepts diagrams 


`Push`, `Repository`, `Clone`, `Pull`, `Pull Request`, `Branch`, `Merging`, `Github Client`, `README file`, `Private or Public`

#### Question 1

`matrix(c(1,2,3,4,5,6) , nrow = 3)`

* Running the expression produces the following matrix

|  |  |
|---|---|
| 1 | 4 |
| 2 | 5 |
| 3 | 6 |

* How can you modify the call to `matrix()` to produce the following matrix instead?

|   | col_1 |  col_2 |
| --- |---|---|
| row_1 | 1 | 2 |
| row_2 | 3 | 4 |
| row_3 | 5 | 6 |


* Note that you need to name the columns (col_1 and col_2) and name the rows (row_1, row_2, row_3)

Hint: Use the `?` symbol to invoke the matrix documentation

```{r}
# Add your code here
?matrix
matrix <- matrix(c(1,2,3,4,5,6) , nrow = 3, dimnames = list(c("row_1", "row_2", "row_3"), c("col_1", "col_2")))
matrix
```

#### Question 2

* Load then sort the airquality data frame on its `Temp` and `Solar.R` columns in reverse order (largest to smallest values)
  * The function to sort a data frame is called order
* Display only the first 15 lines of your table

```{r}
# Write your answer here
data(airquality)
sorteddf <- airquality[order(-airquality$Temp, -airquality$Solar.R), ] 
head(sorteddf, n=15) #shows the first 15 lines of "airquality" data frame
```

#### Question 3

* Sort the airquality data frame on its `Temp` in decreasing order and `Solar.R` in increasing order
* Display only the first 15 lines of your table

```{r}
# Write your answer here
sortedreverse <- airquality[order(airquality$Temp, -airquality$Solar.R), ]
head(sortedreverse, n=15)
```

#### Question 4

* There are various ways to select a subset of observations from a data frame.

* Consult your [R Reference Card](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Baggott-refcard-v2.pdf), see `Data Selection and Manipulation` section.
  * What operations can you use to select all observations where the temperature is 72. Give at least two different answers to this question


```{r}
# Write your answer here
#first method:
temp_72 <- airquality$Temp == 72 #find the values where temp = 72 (these will be TRUE) and put this in a new data frame
airquality[temp_72, ] #select the rows in airquality data set where temp_72 is true; column parameter is empty so we can get back all the columns

#second method:
subset(airquality, Temp == 72)
```

#### Question 6

* You may have noticed when working with the `airqulity` data that some values show as `NA`
 * `NA` stands for not available, or missing values.
* A major part of data wrangling consists of cleaning missing values by either:
  * Dropping the lines that have missing values
   * Sometimes we can drop the column with missing values if the column is made of predominantly missing values
  * Imputing the missing values, which uses educated guesses (or more complex algorithms) to fill the missing values
  
* Find and remove all rows that are missing values for the `Solar.R` or `Ozone` variables
* Save the cleaned data to a new data frame called airquality_no_na
  * How many lines have been removed?
  42 lines were removed.

```{r}
# Write your answer here
airquality_no_na <- airquality[!is.na(airquality$Solar.R) & !is.na(airquality$Ozone), ]
nrow(airquality) - nrow(airquality_no_na)
```

#### Question 7
* Let's use a different strategy and impute the missing value.
  * replace the missing values for Solar.R using that month's average.
  * Example:
    * The missing value for line 6 should be replaced with the average for month 5.
    * The missing value for line 97 should be replaced with the average for month 8.

```{r}
# Write your answer here
install.packages("dyplr")
library("dyplr")
avg_by_month <- airquality %>%
  group_by(Month) %>%
  summarize(Average_Solar = mean(Solar.R, na.rm = TRUE), Average_Ozone = mean(Ozone, na.rm = TRUE))
```

```{r}
result_airquality <- airquality %>%
  left_join(avg_by_month, by = "Month") %>%
  mutate(Solar.R = ifelse(is.na(Solar.R), Average_Solar, Solar.R)) %>%
  select(-Average_Solar) %>%
  mutate(Ozone - ifelse(is.na(Ozone), Average_Ozone, Ozone)) %>%
  select(-Average_Ozone)
```
